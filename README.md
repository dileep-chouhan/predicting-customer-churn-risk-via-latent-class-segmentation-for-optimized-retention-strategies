# Predicting Customer Churn Risk via Latent Class Segmentation for Optimized Retention Strategies

## Overview

This project analyzes customer data from a retail business to predict customer churn risk.  Using latent class segmentation, we identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. This allows for the development of targeted retention strategies aimed at maximizing customer lifetime value by focusing resources on high-risk segments. The analysis involves data preprocessing, model building, and visualization of key findings.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key findings to the console, including details about the identified customer segments, their churn probabilities, and relevant statistical metrics.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segment_distribution.png`, `churn_probability_by_segment.png`) which are saved in the project's directory. These visualizations provide a visual representation of the customer segmentation and churn risk profiles.  The specific outputs may vary depending on the input dataset.


## Data Requirements

The project expects a CSV file named `customer_data.csv` in the project's root directory. This file should contain relevant customer data including, but not limited to:  customer ID, purchase history, demographics, and any other relevant features.  A sample `customer_data.csv` file is provided for demonstration purposes.  You will need to replace this with your own data for meaningful analysis.  The specific column names and data types should be adapted to your data.
